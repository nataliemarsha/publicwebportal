CHAPTER6: SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND  TESTING
===================================================
This chapter contains the different modules that have been created to help realize the
specified user requirements subject to constraints which were collected, analyzed and
even modeled. This chapter will also encompass the approach used to perform design
of the system.


**APPROACH**
--------------
To design the system, a top-down method was used in which I first described the high-
level architecture of the system and then gradually define the sub components of each
components every module was refined to the detailed level
