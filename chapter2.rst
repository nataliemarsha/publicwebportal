CHAPTER 2:
===========

Background
-----------
DHIS2 is a tool for collection, validation, analysis, and presentation of aggregate and patient-based statistical data, tailored (but not limited) to integrated health information management activities.
It is a generic tool rather than a pre-configured database application, with an open meta-data model and a flexible user interface that allows the user to design the contents of a specific information system without the need for programming.
There is currently no  system that the pulic can refer to in order to view the information that is in the DHIS 2.
For one to be able to see or access the information one has to ask for permission from the Ministry of Health.


Proposed System
---------------
This web portal will therefore offer access of the information in various forms such as graphs and charts to the public.
The various visualizations will also be downloadable.
The web portal also has an Admin side where the county HROs can configure data.
or add important information that they want to relay to the public.
